            <h2>A brief history of the Nakasendo trail</h2>
            <p>The Nakasendo trail was used by samurai warriors and traders traveling between the old capital Edo and Kyoto. The road featured small posttowns
                where travellers could eat and rest over night.

            <h2>How to get there</h2>
            <p>Fly to Tokyo, travel by bullet train or "shinkansen" from Tokyo to Nakatsugawa, then take the local bus to Magome post town.</p>
