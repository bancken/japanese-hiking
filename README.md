Hiking the Nakasendo trail

This website is about a hike on the nakasendo trail in Japan that I did with my girlfriend in october 2023.
All photos on this site are my own.

My goal was to shape the site as to be a fictive travel agency selling the idea of hiking this particular stretch.

    when to hike it, and how to get there with some photos to add interest and to invite travelers to explore
*   Itinerary focus on a possible path to take on the trail that I took last year, featuring some description to
    invite potential "fictive" customers to plan their own hike. This itinerary is expected to take 3 days to complete in a leasury pace.
